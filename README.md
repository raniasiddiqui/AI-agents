# AI-agents

Welcome to my journey of learning and building AI agents from scratch — one step at a time. I created this repository to document my learning path into AI agents — beginning from the basics and evolving into more complex and interactive projects. My goal has been to go beyond tutorials and truly understand how agents perceive, plan, and act, often under uncertainty or in dynamic environments.

Through this repo, I am going to be exploring: 
- Basics of AI agents and how they work.
- Diving into hands on implementation of AI agents
- Building projects along the way

This is a personal learning project, but I'm always open to feedback, suggestions, or discussions. Feel free to open issues or contribute if something sparks your interest.
